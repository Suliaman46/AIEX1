# AIEX1
# OBJECTIVE
A program that minimizes a function 𝐽: 𝑅^d → 𝑅 using two gradient-based methods.
The optimized function of the following form: 𝐽(𝑥) = 𝑐 + 𝑏"𝑥 + 𝑥"𝐴𝑥 
where 𝑐 is a scalar number, 𝑏 is a d-dimensional real vector, and A is a positive–definite matrix – all parameters are specified by the user
# METHODS
Simple gradient descent method

Newton’s method

# RESULT
Found solution 𝑥∗ along with the function value 𝐽(𝑥∗).

# BATCH MODE
Run program so that the optimization gets restarted n-times and the found solutions’ means and standard deviations are reported.
